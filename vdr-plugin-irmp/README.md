Description: The 'irmp' plugin sends keypresses from a IRMP Pico Device to VDR.

The easiest way for creating key mappings in remote.conf is to use VDR's key learning process.

Set repeat_delay and repeat_period to 0.

If you use the vdr-plugin-softhddevice, you need to disable softhddevice's remote control function with -P'softhddevice ... -N'.
